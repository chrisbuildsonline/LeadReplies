# Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Docker Compose File Extension âœ…
- **Problem**: Coolify was looking for `docker-compose.yaml` but file was `docker-compose.yml`
- **Solution**: Created `docker-compose.yaml` with correct extension

### 2. Port Conflicts âœ…
- **Problem**: PostgreSQL port 5432 was already in use on server
- **Solution**: Removed external port exposure for PostgreSQL (internal only)

### 3. Frontend Build Issues âœ…
- **Problem**: Frontend was missing `vite` package and built assets in production
- **Solution**: Fixed Dockerfile.frontend to:
  - Install all dependencies during build (including dev deps)
  - Run complete build process (`vite build && esbuild`)
  - Copy built assets to correct location (`server/public`)
  - Set proper environment variables

### 4. Backend Health Check âœ…
- **Problem**: Backend health check was too strict during startup
- **Solution**: 
  - Added database connection retry logic
  - Increased health check retries and start period
  - Made health check more resilient during startup

## Current Status

From the logs:
- âœ… **PostgreSQL**: Starting successfully and ready
- âœ… **Backend**: Should now start properly with database retry logic
- âœ… **Frontend**: Build process fixed, should serve static assets correctly
- âœ… **Background Service**: Will start after backend is healthy

## Next Deployment

The next deployment should work correctly. The services will start in this order:

1. **PostgreSQL** - Database initializes and becomes healthy
2. **Backend** - API server connects to database and starts
3. **Frontend** - Web application serves built React app
4. **Background** - Reddit scraping service starts (with your optimized keyword batching!)

## Environment Variables Needed in Coolify

Make sure these are set in your Coolify application:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-deepseek-key
DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com/v1
DB_NAME=reddit_leads
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
SCRAPING_INTERVAL_MINUTES=120
```

## Your Reddit Scraper Features

Once deployed, your app will have:
- âœ… **Automatic Keyword Batching**: Handles 100+ keywords efficiently
- âœ… **Smart Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays and retry logic
- âœ… **F5Bot Techniques**: Multiple search methods for better results
- âœ… **AI Analysis**: DeepSeek integration for lead scoring
- âœ… **Multi-tenant**: Support for multiple businesses and users

The deployment should now complete successfully! ðŸš€
