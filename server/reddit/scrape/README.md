## Tips for Better Results

1. **Use specific keywords** - "email automation" vs "email"
2. **Target relevant subreddits** - Focus on communities where your audience hangs out
3. **Adjust days_back** - Recent posts (1-4 days) often have more engaged users
4. **Monitor continuously** - Catch opportunities as they happen
5. **Filter by engagement** - Higher upvotes/comments = more active discussions

## Legal & Ethical Usage

- Only scrape public Reddit data
- Respect rate limits (built-in delays)
- Don't spam or self-promote excessively
- Follow Reddit's terms of service
- Use data responsibly

## Troubleshooting

**No leads found?**
- Check if keywords are too specific
- Verify subreddit names (no 'r/' prefix)
- Increase days_back or limit values

**Rate limited?**
- Built-in delays should prevent this
- If it happens, the scraper will automatically retry

**Want more leads?**
- Add more relevant keywords
- Include more subreddits
- Increase the limit parameter
- Extend days_back range
